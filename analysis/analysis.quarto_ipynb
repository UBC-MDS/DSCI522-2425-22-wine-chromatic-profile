        "This project seeks to answer the following question:   \n",
        "**\"Can we predict the color of wine using its physiochemical properties, such as acidity, sugar content, and alcohol level?\"** \n",
        "\n",
        "To answer this question, we are using a [data set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) from the Vinho Verde region in Portugal . These datasets, publicly available through the UCI Machine Learning Repository, include 11 physiochemical attributes for each wine sample—such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, pH, and alcohol content—along with a sensory-based quality score ranging from 0 to 10. The red wine dataset contains 1,599 samples, while the white wine dataset includes 4,898 samples, enabling a comprehensive analysis across different types of wine.\n",
        "\n",
        "The ability to accurately classify wine color using machine learning could offer several advantages. For instance, winemakers and researchers could efficiently analyze large datasets, identify trends, and optimize production processes. Furthermore, consumers or wine retailers might use such tools to assess or verify wine characteristics without requiring advanced laboratory equipment. By developing a robust classification model, we aim to contribute to the wine industry’s growing adoption of data-driven methods, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in identifying and categorizing wines. Ultimately, this approach could lead to scalable, reproducible, and cost-effective methods for wine analysis.\n",

        "\n",
        "The dataset was initially loaded into a single dataframe, and several data validation checks were performed to check the quality of the dataset. An exploratory data analysis was conducted afterwards to understand the distribution of features. This included checking for class imbalance in the target variable, examining collinearity between input features, and identifying the types of features present in the dataset. This analysis informed decisions regarding feature encoding in subsequent steps.\n"

        "`fixed_acidity`: it should be a float between 3.5 and 16. Extreme values outside this range are rare and could indicate measurement errors or outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "`volatile_acidity` : a float column between 0.08 and 1.6. Higher values indicate excessive volatile acidity, which could be abnormal for wine quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "`citric_acid`: a float column between 0 and 1. Citric acid levels rarely exceed 1. A value of 0 is acceptable but beyond 1.0 may suggest data anomalies. \n",
        "\n",
        "`residual_sugar`: a float column between 0.5 and 66. While white wines have higher residual sugar, 66 is a reasonable upper limit based on the observed range. Values exceeding this are highly unusual and likely outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "`chlorides`: a float column between 0.01 and 0.7. The majority of chloride values are tightly distributed below 0.7.\n",
        "\n",
        "`free_sulfur_dioxide`: a float column between 0 and 200. Values beyond 200 are rare and not typical in wines. \n",
        "\n",
        "`total_sulfur_dioxide`: a float column between 0 and 400. Total sulfur dioxide values above 400 are uncommon and may indicate anomalies in the data or unusual winemaking practices.\n",
        "\n",
        "`density`: a float column between 0.985 and 1.04. Density for wines typically lies within this range.\n",
        "\n",
        "`pH`: a float column between 2.5 and 4. Wine pH is generally between 2.5 and 4.0, consistent with its acidic nature. Values outside this range are rare and potentially invalid. \n",
        "\n",
        "`sulphates`: a float column between 0.2 and 1.8. Most sulphates fall within this range; higher values indicate unusual conditions. Lower values below 0.2 are atypical and may require closer inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "`alcohol`: a float column between 8 and 15. Wine alcohol content is normally within 8% to 15%. Values outside this range suggest non-standard wine or errors in measurement.\n",
        "\n",
        "`quality`: a float column between 3 and 9. The wine quality score ranges from 3 to 9 based on the dataset. \n"

        "___\n",
        "From the results above, we see that the logistic regression with balanced class weight performs very well in the validation set as it scores more than 0.98 for all metrics, showing both a high performance in accuracy and much less classification bias due to very high recall and precision scores. Since the validation accuracy score is very high (>0.994), we decide to do a further randomized search cross-validation using the F1 score to find an optimized hyperparameter C that can minimize our classification bias.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Using the optimized model on the test data, we see that the model has a high accuracy score as well (0.985). Moreover, from the confusion matrix, we see that there are very few false positives (false red) and false negatives (false white) compared to the true ones. This implies that the recall and precision scores are near 1 on the test data. This is further supported by the precision-recall curve as the average precision is 0.99 and the precision score maintains constantly very close to 1 when adjusting the threshold in the model.  \n",
        "\n",
        "With the results being near perfect with the predictions on the test data, this is out of our expectations as we would expect there will be a more flawed prediction that will not perform as great in both recall and precision in general (especially not when both recall and precision are higher than 0.98). \n",
        "\n",
        "The near perfect scores in the test data suggest that our model will probably do a great job in predicting the wine type given any new data. However, we also have to bear in mind that the possibility that the model might not perform as well on actual unseen data. These very high scores are quite alarming that we might have to worry that it somehow overfits on both our train and test data and cannot generalize over new unseen data.  \n",
